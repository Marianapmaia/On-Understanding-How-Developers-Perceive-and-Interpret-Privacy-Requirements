### Abstract:
<div style="text-align: justify">Context: Organisations are becoming more and more concerned with effectively dealing with privacy-related requirements in order to cope with the demands by customers, but also by data protection regulations and norms. Deal ing with privacy in the Software Development lifecycle. Available Requirements Engineering methods suffer from several limitations regarding an effective and efficient elicitation and specification of privacy requirements. To assist developers in organizations working with privacy requirements specification, in our previous work, we proposed a structured natural-language approach called “Privacy
Criteria Method” (PCM). Objective: Our goal is to present PCM and report on its evaluation focusing on i) software practitioners’ opinions on PCM’s ability to support the specification of privacy requirements and ii) the quality of the privacy requirements specification generated using PCM. Method : We conducted a multiple case study to evaluate PCM in several industrial contexts. Based on the data collected from 21 professionals from four companies, we gauged practitioner’s opinion regarding Coverage, Applicability, Usefulness, and Scalability. Moreover, we assessed the syntactic and semantic quality of the specification professionals produced using PCM. Results: PCM shows potential to aid software developers in elaborating requirements specifications focused on privacy. The study participants found PCM to be useful for their software development projects, although some adaptations are required. Conclusion: In this evaluation, we show that the adoption of PCM holds the potential to help developers address privacy requirements specification and also reinforce the need for improving the privacy culture in organizations.</div>

### Research Questions (RQ): 

RQ1: What is the quality of the specifications that were obtained using PCM?

RQ2: What is the coverage of the privacy concerns in the specifications that were obtained using PCM?

RQ3: How useful is PCM from the practitioners’ point of view?

RQ4: How applicable is PCM from the practitioners’ point of view?

RQ5: What are privacy concerns either missing or considered to be excessive in the PCM structure?

RQ6: How scalable is PCM from the practitioners’ point of view?

### Practitioners Evaluation
<div style="text-align: justify">Questionnaires we used to evaluate practitioners' perception of PCM. </div>


### Pre-Questionnaire


### Part 1- Demographics

D1- What is currently your role in the organization?

D2- How many years of experience do you have in this industry sector?

D3- To what extent would you rate your team as working in an Agile manner? Instruction: We need you to answer, using the following scale, which ranges from -3 (not Agile at all) to +3 (completely Agile).

D3.1– Which Agile practices would you say are closest to the practices that your team is using?

D3.2- Please elaborate on your answer in terms of your team’s Agile practices

### Part 2- Privacy Characterization

PC4- How would you describe/interpret  how your team views the concept of ‘privacy’ when you develop your product/service?

PC5- To what extent does your team consider ‘privacy’ when developing your product/service? (Instruction: We need you to answer, using the following scale, which ranges from -3 (my team does not consider 
‘privacy‘ at all) to +3 (my team considers ‘privacy’ in its totality)).

PC5.1- Please elaborate on the answer that you provided to the previous question.

PC6- What sources of information do you use to address privacy concerns when you develop software?

PC6.1- Please elaborate on your perceptions of the sources that you use and why you do not use certain sources.

PC7- How does your team document privacy aspects during the software development process?

PC7.1- Please elaborate on your perceptions of the privacy documentation practices that are followed by your team.

PC7.2- Does your team use a specific tool or method (UML, User Stories, Scenarios, etc.) to analyze privacy aspects during software development?

PC7.2.1- Please elaborate on your answer with regards to the tool or method (UML, User Stories, Scenarios, etc.) that your team uses to analyze privacy aspects during software development.
